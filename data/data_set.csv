101,"A lady was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and respiratory insufficiency. She has chronic lung disease with bronchospastic angina. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) Ms. ABCD is a 69-year-old lady, who was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and respiratory insufficiency. She has chronic lung disease with bronchospastic angina. We discovered new T-wave abnormalities on her EKG. There was of course a four-vessel bypass surgery in 2001. We did a coronary angiogram. This demonstrated patent vein grafts and patent internal mammary vessel and so there was no obvious new disease. She may continue in the future to have angina and she will have nitroglycerin available for that if needed. Her blood pressure has been elevated and so instead of metoprolol, we have started her on Coreg 6.25 mg b.i.d. This should be increased up to 25 mg b.i.d. as preferred antihypertensive in this lady's case. She also is on Plavix and aspirin"

104,"Patient with significant angina with moderate anteroapical ischemia on nuclear perfusion stress imaging only. He has been referred for cardiac catheterization. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) A 60-year-old gentleman with markedly abnormal stress test in my office today who is admitted with significant angina with moderate anteroapical ischemia on nuclear perfusion stress imaging only. He has been referred for cardiac catheterization. I discussed the procedure in detail with the patient and his wife as well as perform a risk/benefit/alternative analysis with benefits being more definitive exclusion of significant obstructive coronary artery disease and evaluation of such to help guide further treatment, alternatives being alternative stress imaging or empiric medical therapy which I was not recommending nor was the patient interested in and risks including but not limited to and the patient and his wife were aware that this was not an all inclusive list of over-sedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, risk of excessive fluoroscopic exposure causing skin necrosis, risk of dye reaction as well as due to the inherent invasive nature of cardiac catheterization at least 1 in 1,000 risk of stroke, heart attack, heart failure, death, kidney failure, peripheral vascular disease, femoral arteriotomy access site complications including bleeding, need for surgical intervention of the femoral arteriotomy access site, aneurysmal formation, pseudoaneurysmal formation, and/or need for blood transfusions. The patient expressed understanding of this risk/benefit/alternative analysis and stated in a clear competent and coherent fashion that he wished to go forward with the cardiac catheterization which I felt was appropriate. PROCEDURE NOTE: The patient was brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab in a fasting state. All appropriate labs had been reviewed. Bilateral groins were prepped and draped in the usual fashion for sterile conditions. The appropriate time-out procedure was performed with appropriate identification of the patient, procedure, physician, position and documentation all done under my direct supervision and there were no safety issues raised by the staff. He received a total of 2 mg of Versed and 50 mcg of Fentanyl utilizing titrated concentration with good effect. Bilateral groins had been prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Right femoral inguinal fossa was anesthetized with 1% topical lidocaine and a 6-French vascular sheath was put into place percutaneously via guide-wire exchanger with a finder needle. All catheters were passed using a J-tipped guide-wire. Left heart catheterization and left ventriculography performed using a 6-French pigtail catheter. Left system coronary angiography performed using a 6-French JL4 catheter. Right system coronary angiography performed using a 6-French CDRC catheter. Following the procedure, all catheters were removed. Manual pressure was held with the Neptune pad and the patient was discharged back to his room. I inspected the femoral arteriotomy site after the procedure was complete and it was benign without evidence of hematoma nor bruit with intact distal pulses. There were no apparent complications. A total of 77 cc of Isovue dye and 1.4 minutes of fluoroscopy time were utilized during the case. FINDINGS: We are going to continue the patient's aspirin, ans metoprolol as heart rate tolerates as he tends to run on the bradycardic side and add statin. We will check a fasting lipid profile and ALT and titrate statin therapy to keep LDL of 70 mg/deciliter or less but in the past the patient's LDL had been higher or high. "

106,"Description: Aortogram with bilateral, segmental lower extremity run off. Left leg claudication. The patient presents with lower extremity claudication. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Left leg claudication. POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Left leg claudication. OPERATION PERFORMED: Aortogram with bilateral, segmental lower extremity run off. ANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation. INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: The patient presents with lower extremity claudication. She is a 68-year-old woman, who is very fearful of the aforementioned procedures. Risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to her to include bleeding, infection, arterial trauma requiring surgery, access issues and recurrence. She appears to understand and agrees to proceed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the Angio Suite, placed in a supine position. After adequate conscious sedation, both groins were prepped with Chloraseptic prep. Cloth towels and paper drapes were placed. Local anesthesia was administered in the common femoral artery and using ultrasound guidance, the common femoral artery was accessed. Guidewire was threaded followed by a 4-French sheath. Through the 4-French sheath a 4-French Omni flush catheter was placed. The glidewire was removed and contrast administered to identify the level of the renal artery. Using power injector an aortogram proceeded. The catheter was then pulled down to the aortic bifurcation. A timed run-off view of both legs was performed and due to a very abnormal and delayed run-off in the left, I opted to perform an angiogram of the left lower extremity with an isolated approach. The catheter was pulled down to the aortic bifurcation and using a glidewire, I obtained access to the contralateral left external iliac artery. The Omni flush catheter was advanced to the left distal external iliac artery. The glidewire rather exchanged for an Amplatz stiff wire. This was left in place and the 4-French sheath removed and replaced with a 6-French destination 45-cm sheath. This was advanced into the proximal superficial femoral artery and an angiogram performed. I identified a functionally occluded distal superficial femoral artery and after obtaining views of the run off made plans for angioplasty. The patient was given 5000 units of heparin and this was allowed to circulate. To avoid placing a stent in the small vessel I left it alone and approached the popliteal artery. A 3-mm balloon was chosen to dilate a 50 to 79% popliteal artery stenosis. Reasonable use were obtained and possibly a 4-mm balloon could have been used. However, due to her propensity for dissection I opted not to. I then exchanged the glidewire for an O1 for Thruway guidewire using an exchange length. This was placed into the left posterior tibial artery. A 2-mm balloon was used to dilate the orifice of the posterior tibial artery. I then moved the wire to the perineal artery and dilated the proximal aspect of this vessel. Final images showed improved run-off to the right calf. The destination sheath was pulled back into the left external iliac artery and an Angio-Seal deployed. Run-off to the left lower extremity is via a patent perineal and posterior tibial artery. We started on ace metoprolol, statin, and diuretics, no aspirin."
107,"Sample Name: Aortobifemoral Bypass - 1 Description: Dementia and aortoiliac occlusive disease bilaterally. Aortobifemoral bypass surgery utilizing a bifurcated Hemashield graft. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS 1. Aortoiliac occlusive disease bilaterally. 2. Dementia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS 1. Aortoiliac occlusive disease bilaterally. 2. Dementia. OPERATION: Aortobifemoral bypass surgery utilizing a bifurcated Hemashield graft. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 300 cc INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS: 1200 cc of crystalloid URINE OUTPUT: 250 cc OPERATION IN DETAIL: After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered. Note that previously the patient was found to have some baseline dementia, although slight. The patient was seen and evaluated by the neurology team, who cleared the patient for surgery. The patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. We first began our dissection by using a #10-blade scalpel to incise the skin over the femoral artery in the groin bilaterally. Dissection was carried down to the level of the femoral vessels using Bovie electrocautery. The common femoral, superficial femoral, and profunda femoris arteries were encircled and dissected out peripherally. Vessel loops were placed around the aforementioned arteries. After doing so, we turned our attention to beginning our abdominal dissection. We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline laparotomy incision. Dissection was carried down to the level of the fascia using Bovie electrocautery. The abdomen was opened and an Omni retractor was positioned. The aorta was dissected out in the abdomen. The left femoral vein was identified. There was a nicely clampable portion of aorta visible. We, as mentioned, placed our Omni retractor and then turned our attention to performing our anastomosis. Full-dose heparin was given. Next, vascular clamps were applied to the iliac vessels as well as to the proximal aorta just below the renal vessels. A #11-blade scalpel was used to make an arteriotomy in the aorta, which was lengthened both proximally and distally using Potts scissors. We then beveled our proximal graft and constructed an end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 3-0 Prolene in a running fashion. Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed our graft and noted there was no evidence of a leak from the newly constructed anastomosis. We then created our tunnels over the iliac vessels. Patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the intensive care unit in good condition. Patient started on aspirin and antibiotics"
108,"Sample Name: Aortobifemoral Bypass Description: Aortoiliac occlusive disease. Aortobifemoral bypass. The aorta was of normal size and consistency consistent with arteriosclerosis. A 16x8 mm Gore-Tex graft was placed without difficulty. The femoral vessels were small somewhat thin and there was posterior packing, but satisfactory bypass was performed. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Aortoiliac occlusive disease. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Aortoiliac occlusive disease. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Aortobifemoral bypass. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient was taken to the operating room. The abdominal contents were within normal limits. The aorta was of normal size and consistency consistent with arteriosclerosis. A 16x8 mm Gore-Tex graft was placed without difficulty. The femoral vessels were small somewhat thin and there was posterior packing, but satisfactory bypass was performed. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in a supine position, and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with Betadine solution. A longitudinal incision was made after a Betadine-coated drape was placed over the incisional area. Longitudinal incision was made over each groin initially and carried down to the subcutaneous fat and fascia. Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery. The common deep and superficial femoral arteries were exposed and then these incisions were covered with antibiotic soaked sponges. Attention was then turned to the abdomen, where a longitudinal incision was made from the pubis xiphoid, carried down subcutaneous fat and fascia. Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery. The abdomen was entered above the umbilicus and then this was extended with care inferiorly as the patient has undergone previous abdominal surgery. Mild adhesions were lysed. The omentum was freed. The small and large intestine were run with no evidence of abnormalities. The liver and gallbladder were within normal limits. No abnormalities were noted. At this point, the Bookwalter retractor was placed. NG tube was placed in the stomach and placed on suction. The intestines were gently packed intraabdominally and laterally. The rest of the peritoneum was then opened. The aorta was cleared, both proximally and distally. The left iliac was completely occluded. The right iliac was to be cleansed. At this point, 5000 units of aqueous heparin was administered to allow take effect. The aorta was then clamped below the renal arteries and opened in a longitudinal fashion. A single lumbar was ligated with #3-0 Prolene. The inferior mesenteric artery was occluded intraluminally and required no suture closure. Care was taken to preserve collaterals. The aorta was measured, and a 16 mm Gore-Tex graft was brought on the field and anastomosed to the proximal aorta using #3-0 Prolene in a running fashion. Last stitch was tied. The abdominal wall was closed in a running single layer fashion using #1 PDS. The skin was closed with skin staples. The groins were again irrigated, closed with #3-0 Vicryl and #4-0 undyed Vicryl and Steri-Strips. The patient was then taken into the recovery room in satisfactory condition after tolerating the procedure well. Sponges and instrument counts were correct. Estimated blood loss 900 cc. "
109,"Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary Sample Name: Aortic Valve Replacement Description: Aortic valve replacement using a mechanical valve and two-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure using saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery and left radial artery graft to the left anterior descending artery. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) DIAGNOSIS: Aortic valve stenosis with coronary artery disease associated with congestive heart failure. The patient has diabetes and is morbidly obese. Patient started on clopidrogel and lisnopril. PROCEDURES: Aortic valve replacement using a mechanical valve and two-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure using saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery and left radial artery graft to the left anterior descending artery. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal INCISION: Median sternotomy INDICATIONS: The patient presented with severe congestive heart failure associated with the patient's severe diabetes. The patient was found to have moderately stenotic aortic valve. In addition, The patient had significant coronary artery disease consisting of a chronically occluded right coronary artery but a very important large obtuse marginal artery coming off as the main circumflex system. The patient also has a left anterior descending artery which has moderate disease and this supplies quite a bit of collateral to the patient's right system. It was decided to perform a valve replacement as well as coronary artery bypass grafting procedure. FINDINGS: The left ventricle is certainly hypertrophied· The aortic valve leaflet is calcified and a severe restrictive leaflet motion. It is a tricuspid type of valve. The patient went on cardiopulmonary bypass and the aortic cross-clamp was applied Cardioplegia was delivered through the coronary sinuses in a retrograde manner. The patient was cooled to 32 degrees. Iced slush was applied to the heart. The aortic valve was then exposed through the aortic root by transverse incision. The valve leaflets were removed and the #23 St. Jude mechanical valve was secured into position by circumferential pledgeted sutures. At this point, aortotomy was closed. The first obtuse marginal artery was a very large target and the vein graft to this target indeed produced an excellent amount of flow. Proximal anastomosis was then carried out to the foot of the aorta. The left anterior descending artery does not have severe disease but is also a very good target and the radial artery was anastomosed to this target in an end-to-side manner. The two proximal anastomoses were then carried out to the root of the aorta. The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass after aortic cross-clamp was released. The patient was adequately warmed. Protamine was given without adverse effect. Sternal closure was then done using wires. The subcutaneous layers were closed using Vicryl suture. The skin was approximated using staples."
110,"Sample Name: Angiography & Catheterization - 1 Description: Selective coronary angiography of the right coronary artery, left main LAD, left circumflex artery, left ventricular catheterization, left ventricular angiography, angioplasty of totally occluded mid RCA, arthrectomy using 6-French catheter, stenting of the mid RCA, stenting of the proximal RCA, femoral angiography and Perclose hemostasis. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) INDICATION: Acute coronary syndrome. CONSENT FORM: The procedure of cardiac catheterization/PCI risks included but not restricted to death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, emergent open heart surgery, bleeding, hematoma, limb loss, renal failure requiring dialysis, blood loss, infection had been explained to him. He understands. All questions answered and is willing to sign consent. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Selective coronary angiography of the right coronary artery, left main LAD, left circumflex artery, left ventricular catheterization, left ventricular angiography, angioplasty of totally occluded mid RCA, arthrectomy using 6-French catheter, stenting of the mid RCA, stenting of the proximal RCA, femoral angiography and Perclose hemostasis. NARRATIVE: The patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a fasting state. Both groins were draped and sterilized in the usual fashion. Local anesthesia was achieved with 2% lidocaine to the right groin area and a #6-French femoral sheath was inserted via modified Seldinger technique in the right common femoral artery. Selective coronary angiography was performed with #6 French JL4 catheter for the left coronary system and a #6 French JR4 catheter of the right coronary artery. Left ventricular catheterization and angiography was performed at the end of the procedure with a #6-French angle pigtail catheter. FINDINGS 1. Hemodynamics systemic blood pressure 140/70 mmHg. LVEDP at the end of the procedure was 13 mmHg. 2. The left main coronary artery is a large with mild diffuse disease in the distal third resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis at the take off of the left circumflex artery. The left circumflex artery is a large caliber vessel with diffuse disease in the ostium of the proximal segment resulting in less than 30% angiographic stenosis. The left circumflex artery gives rise to a high small obtuse marginal branch that has high moderate-to-severe ostium. The rest of the left circumflex artery has mild diffuse disease and it gives rise to a second large obtuse marginal branch that bifurcates into an upper and lower trunk. The LAD is calcified and diffusely disease in the proximal and mid portion. There is mild nonobstructive disease in the proximal LAD resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis. 3. The right coronary artery is dominant. It is septal to be occluded in the mid portion. The findings were discussed with the patient and she opted for PCI. Angiomax bolus was started. The ACT was checked. It was higher in 300. I have given the patient 600 mg of oral Plavix. The right coronary artery was engaged using a #6-French JR4 guide catheter. I was unable to cross through this lesion using a BMW wire and a 3.0x8 mm balloon support. I was unable to cross with this lesion using a whisper wire. I was unable to cross with this lesion using Cross-IT 100 wire. I have also used second #6-French Amplatz right I guide catheter. At one time, I have lost flow in the distal vessel. The patient experienced severe chest pain, ST-segment elevation, bradycardia, and hypotension, which responded to intravenous fluids and atropine along with intravenous dopamine. Dr. X was notified. Eventually, an Asahi grand slam wire using the same 3.0 x 8 mm Voyager balloon support, I was able to cross into the distal vessel. I have performed careful balloon angioplasty of the mid RCA. I have given nitroglycerin under the nursing several times during the procedure. I then performed arthrectomy using #5-French export catheter. I performed more balloon predilation using a 3.0 x16 mm Voyager balloon. I then deployed 4.0 x15 mm, excised, and across the mid RCA at 18 atmospheres with good angiographic result. Proximal to the proximal edge of the stent, there was still some persistent haziness most likely just diseased artery/diffuse plaquing. I decided to cover this segment using a second 4.0 x 15 mm, excised, and two stents were overlapped, the overlap was postdilated using the same stent delivery balloon at high pressure with excellent angiographic result. Left ventricular catheterization was performed with #6-French angle pigtail catheter. The left ventricle is rather smaller in size. The mid inferior wall is minimally hypokinetic, ejection fraction is 70%. There is no evidence of aortic wall stenosis or mitral regurgitation. Femoral angiography revealed that the entry point was above the bifurcation of the right common femoral artery and I have performed this as Perclose hemostasis. CONCLUSIONS 1. Normal left ventricular size and function. Ejection fraction is 65% to 70%. No MR. 2. Successful angioplasty and stenting of the subtotally closed mid RCA. This was hard, organized thrombus, very difficult to penetrate. I have deployed two overlapping 4.0 x15 mm excised and with excellent angiographic result. The RCA is dominant. 3. No moderate disease in the distal left main. Moderate disease in the ostium of the left circumflex artery. Mild disease in the proximal LAD. PLAN: Recommend smoking cessation. Continue aspirin lifelong and continue Plavix and clopidogrel bisulfate for at least 12 months. "
111,"Sample Name: Angiography & Catheterization Description: Left heart catheterization, bilateral selective coronary angiography, left ventriculography, and right heart catheterization. Positive nuclear stress test involving reversible ischemia of the lateral wall and the anterior wall consistent with left anterior descending artery lesion. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Left heart catheterization. 2. Bilateral selective coronary angiography. 3. Left ventriculography. 4. Right heart catheterization. INDICATION: Positive nuclear stress test involving reversible ischemia of the lateral wall and the anterior wall consistent with left anterior descending artery lesion. PROCEDURE: After risks, benefits, and alternatives of the above-mentioned procedure were explained in detail to the patient, informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing. The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization suite where the right femoral region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery and vein. Once adequate anesthesia has been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery. A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance. A small nick was then made in the skin. The pressure was held. The needle was removed over the guidewire. Next, a #6 French arterial sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance. The guidewire and dilator were then removed. The sheath was flushed. Next, an angulated pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under the direct fluoroscopy visualization with the use of a guidewire. The catheter was then guided into the left ventricle. The guidewire and dilator were then removed. The catheter was then flushed. LVEDP was measured and found to be favorable for a left ventriculogram. The left ventriculogram was performed in the RAO position with a single power injection of nonionic contrast material. LVEDP was then remeasured. Pullback was performed, which failed to reveal an LVAO gradient. The catheter was then removed. Next, a Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire. The guidewire was removed. The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed. The ostium of the left main coronary was unable to be engaged with this catheter. Thus it was removed over a guidewire. Next, a Judkins left #5 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire. The guidewire was removed. The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed. Left main coronary artery was then engaged. Using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the left coronary system was evaluated in several different views. The catheter was then removed from the ostium of the left main coronary artery and was removed over a guidewire. Next, a Judkins right #4 catheter was then advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire. The guidewire was removed. The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed. Using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the right coronary system was evaluated in several different views. The catheter was then removed from the ostium of the right coronary artery and then removed. The sheath was then flushed. Because the patient did have high left ventricular end-diastolic pressures, it was determined that the patient wound need a right heart catheterization. Thus an #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral vein. A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen. The needle was removed over the guidewire. Next, an #8 French venous sheath was advanced over the guidewire into lumen without resistance. The guidewire and dilator were then removed. The sheath was then flushed. Next, a Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced to the level of 20 cm. The balloon was inflated. Under fluoroscopic visualization, the catheter was guided into the right atrium, right ventricle, and into the pulmonary artery wedge position. Hemodynamics were measured along the way. PA saturation, right atrial saturation, femoral artery saturation were all obtained. Once adequate study has been performed, the catheter was then removed. Both sheaths were flushed and found fine. The patient was returned to the cardiac catheterization holding area in stable satisfactory condition. FINDINGS: LEFT VENTRICULOGRAM: There is no evidence of any wall motion abnormalities with estimated ejection fraction of 60%.

112,"Sample Name: Angiogram & StarClose Closure Description: Left heart cath, selective coronary angiogram, right common femoral angiogram, and StarClose closure of right common femoral artery. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) EXAM: Left heart cath, selective coronary angiogram, right common femoral angiogram, and StarClose closure of right common femoral artery. REASON FOR EXAM: Abnormal stress test and episode of shortness of breath. PROCEDURE: Right common femoral artery, 6-French sheath, JL4, JR4, and pigtail catheters were used. We started on aspirin and profol for the next hours. FINDINGS: 1. Left main is a large-caliber vessel. It is angiographically free of disease, 2. LAD is a large-caliber vessel. It gives rise to two diagonals and septal perforator. It erupts around the apex. LAD shows an area of 60% to 70% stenosis probably in its mid portion. The lesion is a type A finishing before the takeoff of diagonal 1. The rest of the vessel is angiographically free of disease. 3. Diagonal 1 and diagonal 2 are angiographically free of disease. 4. Left circumflex is a small-to-moderate caliber vessel, gives rise to 1 OM. It is angiographically free of disease. 5. OM-1 is angiographically free of disease. 6. RCA is a large, dominant vessel, gives rise to conus, RV marginal, PDA and one PL. RCA has a tortuous course and it has a 30% to 40% stenosis in its proximal portion. 7. LVEDP is measured 40 mmHg. 8. No gradient between LV and aorta is noted. Due to contrast concern due to renal function, no LV gram was performed. Following this, right common femoral angiogram was performed followed by StarClose closure of the right common femoral artery. IMPRESSION: 1. 60% to 70% mid left anterior descending stenosis. 2. Mild 30% to 40% stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery. 3. Status post StarClose closure of the right common femoral artery. PLAN: Plan will be to perform elective PCI of the mid LAD. "
113,"Sample Name: Angiogram & Angioplasty Description: Lower extremity angiogram, superficial femoral artery laser atherectomy and percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty, external iliac artery angioplasty and stent placement, and completion angiogram. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left superficial femoral artery subtotal stenosis. 2. Arterial insufficiency, left lower extremity. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left superficial femoral artery subtotal stenosis. 2. Arterial insufficiency, left lower extremity. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: 1. Left lower extremity angiogram. 2. Left superficial femoral artery laser atherectomy. 3. Left superficial femoral artery percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty. 4. Left external iliac artery angioplasty. 5. Left external iliac artery stent placement. 6. Completion angiogram. FINDINGS: This patient was brought to the OR with a non-severe stenosis of the proximal left superficial femoral artery in the upper one-third of his thigh. He is also known to have severe calcific disease involving the entire left external iliac system as well as the common femoral and deep femoral arteries. Our initial plan today was to perform an atherectomy with angioplasty and stenting of the left superficial femoral artery as necessary. However, whenever we started the procedure, it became clear that there was a severe stenosis of the left superficial femoral artery at its takeoff from the left common femoral artery. The area was severely calcified including the external iliac artery extending up underneath the left inguinal ligament. Indeed, this ultimately was dissected due to manipulation of sheath catheters and sheath through the area. Ultimately, this wound up being a much more complex case than initially anticipated. Because of the above, we ultimately performed a laser atherectomy of the left superficial femoral artery, which then had to be angioplastied to obtain a satisfactory result. The completion angiogram showed that there was a dissection of the left external iliac artery, which precluded flow down into the left lower extremity. We then had to come up and perform angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery as well as aggressively dilating the takeoff of the less superficial femoral artery from the common femoral artery. The left superficial femoral artery was dilated with a 6-mm balloon. The left external iliac artery and common femoral arteries were dilated with an 8-mm balloon. A 2.5-mm ClearPath laser probe was used to initially arthrectomize and debulk the superficial femoral artery starting at its takeoff from the common femoral artery and extending down to the tight stenotic area in the upper one-third of the thigh. After the laser atherectomy was performed, the area still did not look good and so an angioplasty was then done, which looked good; however, as noted above, after we had dealt with the superficial femoral artery, we then had proximal inflow problems, which had to be dealt by angioplasty and stenting. The patient had good dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally upon completion. The right common femoral artery was used for access in an up-and-over technique. PROCEDURE: With the patient in the supine position under general anesthesia, the abdomen and lower extremities were prepped and draped in the sterile fashion. The right common femoral artery was punctured percutaneously, and a #5-French sheath was initially placed. We used a pigtail catheter to go up and over the aortic bifurcation and placed a stiff Amplatz guidewire down into the left common femoral artery. We then heparinized the patient and placed a #7-French Raby sheath over the Amplatz wire. A selective left lower extremity angiogram was then done with the above-noted findings. We then used a ClearPath 2.5-mm laser probe to laser the proximal superficial femoral artery. Because of the findings as noted above, this became more involved than initially hoped for. Once the laser atherectomy had been completed, the vessel still did not look good, so we used a 6-mm balloon to thoroughly dilate the area. Once that had been done, it looked good and we performed what we felt would be a completion angiogram only to find out that we had a more proximal problem precluding flow down into the left femoral artery. Once that was discovered, we then had to proceed with angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery right down to the acetabular level. Once we had dealt with our run-on problems, we then did another completion angiogram, which showed a good flow through the entire area and down into the left lower extremity. Following completion of the above, all wires, sheaths, and catheters were removed from the right common femoral artery. Firm pressure was held over the puncture site for 20 minutes followed by application of a sterile Coverlet dressing and a firm pressure dressing. The patient tolerated the procedure well throughout. He had good palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally on completion. He was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. Protamine was given to partially reverse the heparin. "
114,"Sample Name: Angina - Consult Description: Patient had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent, three days ago, and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68-year-old woman whom I have been following, who has had angina. In any case today, she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent, three days ago, and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when I spoke to her. I advised her to call 911, which she did. While waiting for 911, she was attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain. By the time she presented here, she is currently pain-free and is feeling well. PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: The patient has been having arm pain for several months. She underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me, which was equivocal, but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia. I had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy, so we put her on a beta-blocker. However, her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain, so she presented to the emergency room. On 08/16/08, she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80% mid LAD lesion, circumflex normal, and RCA totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right, as well as right to right to that area. The decision was made to transfer her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the LAD stenosis to the RCA vessel. She underwent that with drug-eluting stents on 08/16/08, with I believe three or four total placed, and was discharged on 08/17/08. She had some left arm discomfort on 08/18/08, but this was mild. Yesterday, she felt very fatigued, but no arm pain, and today, she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual nitroglycerin. This is her usual angina. She is being admitted with unstable angina post stent. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Longstanding hypertension, CAD as above, hyperlipidemia, and overactive bladder. MEDICATIONS: 1. Detrol. 2. Prilosec for GERD 20 mg once a day. 3. Glucosamine 500/400 mg once a day for arthritis. 4. Multivitamin p.o. daily. 5. Nitroglycerin sublingual as available to her. 6. Toprol-XL 7. Aspirin 8. Plavix 9. Diovan 160 mg once a day. 10. Claritin 10 mg once a day for allergic rhinitis. 11. Norvasc 5 mg once a day. 12. Lipitor 5 mg once a day. 13. Evista 60 mg once a day. ALLERGIES: ALLERGIES TO MEDICATIONS ARE NONE. SHE DENIES ANY SHRIMP OR SEA FOOD ALLERGY. FAMILY HISTORY: Her father died of an MI in his 50s and a brother had his first MI and bypass surgery at 54. SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, no use of illicit drugs. She is divorced and lives alone and is a retired laboratory technician from Cornell Diagnostic Laboratory. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting up blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi, cholelithiasis, asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, home oxygen use or sleep apnea, although she has been told in the past that she snores and there was some question of apnea in 05/08. No morning headaches or fatigue. No psychiatric diagnosis. No psoriasis, no lupus. Remainder of the review of systems is negative x14 systems except as described above. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: She is a pleasant elderly woman, currently in no acute distress. VITAL SIGNS: Height 4 feet 11 inches, weight 128 pounds, temperature 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure 142/70, pulse 47, respiratory rate 16, and O2 saturation 100% HEENT: Cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic. She has moist mucosal membranes. NECK: Veins are not distended. There are no carotid bruits. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation and percussion without wheezes. HEART: S1 and S2, regular rate. No significant murmurs, rubs or gallops. PMI nondisplaced. ABDOMEN: Soft and nondistended. Bowel sounds present. EXTREMITIES: Without significant clubbing, cyanosis or edema. Pulses grossly intact. Bilateral groins are inspected, status post as the right femoral artery was used for access for the diagnostic cardiac catheterization here and left femoral artery used for PCI and there is no evidence of hematoma or bruit and intact distal pulses. LABORATORY DATA: EKG reviewed which shows sinus bradycardia at the rate of 51 beats per minute and no acute disease. Sodium 136, potassium 3.8, chloride 105, and bicarbonate 27. BUN 16 and creatinine 0.9. Glucose 110. Magnesium 2.5. ALT 107 and AST 65 and these were normal on 08/15/08. INR is 0.89, PTT 20.9, white blood cell count 8.2, hematocrit 31 and it was 35 on 08/15/08, and platelet count 257,000. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: The patient is a 68-year-old woman with exertional angina, characterized with arm pain, who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and has now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery. In any case, given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she was even pain free, I am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy. We will continue her beta-blocker and I cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already. Aspirin, Plavix, valsartan, Lipitor, and Norvasc. I am going to add Imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before, and we will rule out MI, although there is a little suspicion. I suppose it is possible that she has non-cardiac arm pain, but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker, so we can maximize beta-blocker use for anti-anginal effect. My concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia, not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention, which was severely stenotic and she does have normal LV function. She will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis, Claritin for allergies, and Detrol LA for urinary incontinence. Total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes. All this was discussed in detail with the patient and her daughter who expressed understanding and agreement. The patient desires full resuscitation status."

118,"Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary Sample Name: Cardiac Catheterization - 1 Description: Cardiac Catheterization - An obese female with a family history of coronary disease and history of chest radiation for Hodgkin disease, presents with an acute myocardial infarction with elevated enzymes. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: A 51-year-old, obese, white female with positive family history of coronary disease and history of chest radiation for Hodgkin disease 20 years ago with no other identifiable risk factors who presents with an acute myocardial infarction with elevated enzymes. The chest pain occurred early Tuesday morning. She was treated with Plavix, Lovenox, etc., and transferred for coronary angiography and possible PCI. The plan was discussed with the patient and all questions answered. PROCEDURE NOTE: Following sterile prep and drape, the right groin and instillation of 1% Xylocaine anesthesia, the right femoral artery was percutaneously entered with a single wall puncture. A 6-French sheath inserted. Selective left and right coronary injections performed using Judkins coronary catheters with a 6-French pigtail catheter used to obtain left ventricle pressures, and a left ventriculography. The left pullback pressure. The catheters withdrawn. Sheath injection. Hemostasis obtained with a 6-French Angio-Seal device. She tolerated the procedure well. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure equals 25 mmHg post A wave. No aortic valve or systolic gradient on pullback. ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS: I. Left coronary artery: The left main coronary artery is normal. The left anterior descending extends to the apex and has only minor luminal irregularities within the midportion of the vessel. Normal diagonal branches. Normal septal perforator branches. The left circumflex is a nondominant vessel with only minor irregularities with normal obtuse marginal branches. II. Right coronary artery: The proximal right coronary artery has a focal calcification. There is minor plaque with luminal irregularity in the proximal and midportion of the vessel with no narrowing greater than 10 to 20% at most. The right coronary artery is a dominant system which gives off normal posterior descending and posterior lateral branches. TIMI 3 flow is present. III. Left ventriculogram: The left ventricle is slightly enlarged with normal contraction of the base, but, with wall motion abnormality involving the anteroapical and inferoapical left ventricle with hypokinesis within the apical portion. Ejection fraction estimated 40%, 1+ mitral regurgitation (echocardiogram ordered). DISCUSSION: Recent inferoapical mild myocardial infarction by left ventriculography and cardiac enzymes with elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure post A wave, but, only minor residual coronary artery plaque with calcification proximal right coronary artery. PLAN: Medical treatment is contemplated, including ACE inhibitor, a beta blocker, aspirin, Plavix, nitrates. An echocardiogram is ordered to exclude apical left ventricular thrombus and to further assess ejection fraction. "
119,"Sample Name: Cardiac Catheterization Description: Left heart catheterization, LV cineangiography, selective coronary angiography, and right heart catheterization with cardiac output by thermodilution technique with dual transducer. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) EXAMINATION: Cardiac catheterization. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Left heart catheterization, LV cineangiography, selective coronary angiography, and right heart catheterization with cardiac output by thermodilution technique with dual transducer. INDICATION: Syncope with severe aortic stenosis. COMPLICATIONS: None. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a post observed state. The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. After adequate conscious sedation and local anesthesia was obtained, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and a 8-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral vein. Following this, a 7.5-French Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced into the right atrium where the right atrial pressure was 10/7 mmHg. DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: The left main coronary artery is a large vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions. The left circumflex artery is a short vessel, which gives off one major obtuse marginal artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions. The left anterior descending artery has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities and gives off two major diagonal branches. There is a 70% ostial lesion in the first diagonal branch and the second diagonal branch has mild-to-moderate luminal irregularities. The right coronary artery is a very large dominant vessel with a 60% to 70% lesion in its descending mid-portion. The remainder of the vessel has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions. The left ventricle appears to be normal sized. The aortic valve is heavily calcified. The estimated ejection fraction is approximately 60%. There was 4+ mitral regurgitation noted. The mean gradient across the aortic valve was noted to be 33 mmHg yielding an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2. CONCLUSION: 1. Moderate-to-severe coronary artery disease with a high-grade lesion seen at the ostium of the first diagonal artery as well as a 60% to 70% lesion seen at the mid portion of the right coronary artery. 2. Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2. 3. 4+ mitral regurgitation. PLAN: The patient will most likely need a transesophageal echocardiogram to better evaluate the valvular architecture and the patient will be referred to Dr Kenneth Fang for possible aortic valve replacement as well as mitral valve repair/replacement and possible surgical revascularization. We started on isosorbide, milrinone and lasix infusion, no captopril "

(Medical Transcription Sample Report) PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Post infarct angina. TYPE OF PROCEDURE: Left cardiac catheterization with selective right and left coronary angiography. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, and the groin was prepped in the usual fashion. Using 1% lidocaine, the right groin was infiltrated, and using the Seldinger technique, the right femoral artery was cannulated. Through this, a moveable guidewire was then advance to the level of the diaphragm, and through it, a 6 French pigtail catheter was advanced under hemodynamic monitoring to the ascending aorta and inserted into the left ventricle. Pressure measurements were obtained and cineangiograms in the RAO and LAO positions were then obtained. Catheter was then withdrawn and a #6 French non-bleed-back sidearm sheath was then introduced, and through this, a 6 French Judkins left coronary catheter was then advanced under hemodynamic monitoring to the left coronary ostium, engaged. Cineangiograms were obtained of the left coronary system. This catheter was then exchanged for a Judkins right 4 coronary catheter of similar dimension and under hemodynamic monitoring again was advanced to the right coronary ostium, engaged. Cineangiograms were obtained, and the catheter and sheath were then withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory in stable condition.

Insertion of Mahurkar catheter for hemofiltration via the left common femoral vein. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: With the patient in the supine position, he was prepped from shin to knees and draped in a sterile field. A right common femoral artery vein were then exposed through a longitudinal incision in the right groin and prepared for cardiopulmonary bypass. A sternotomy incision was then opened and the lesions from the previous operative procedures were lysed and they were very dense and firm, freeing up the right atrium and the ascending aorta and anterior right ventricle. The patient was heparinized and then a pursestring suture was placed in the right atrium superior and inferior just above the superior and inferior vena cava. A percutaneous catheter for arterial return was placed using Seldinger technique through exposed right femoral artery and then two 3-mm catheters were inserted with two pursestring sutures in the right atrium just superior to inferior vena cava. After satisfactory heparinization has been obtained, the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and another pursestring suture was placed in the right superior pulmonary vein and a catheter was placed for suction in the left atrium. After the heart was brought to the operating room and triggered, the patient had the ascending aorta clamped and tapes were placed around superior and inferior vena cava and were secured in place. A cardiectomy was then performed by starting in the right atrium. The wires from the pacemaker and defibrillator were transected coming from the superior vena cava and the Swan-Ganz catheter was brought out into the operative field. Hemofiltration was started in the operating room at this time. After he had satisfactory hemostasis, we decided to do the chest open and cover it with Ioban, which we did, and one chest tube was inserted into the mediastinum through a separate stab wound. The patient also had an intraaortic balloon for counterpulsation which had been inserted into the left subclavian vein preoperatively. This was left in place and the pulse generation, the pacemaker was in a right infraclavicular position, which was left in place because of the coagulopathy. The patient received 11 units of packed red blood cells, 7 platelets, 23 fresh-frozen plasma, 20 cryoprecipitates, and factor VII. Urine output for the procedure was 520 mL. The preservation time of the heart is in the anesthesia sheet. The estimated blood loss was at least 6 L. The patient was taken to the intensive care unit in guarded condition. "

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After obtaining an informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room where a time-out process was followed. Initially, the patient was intubated with a #6 French tube because of the presence of previous laryngectomy. Because of this, I proceeded to use a pediatric bronchoscope, which provided limited visualization, but I was able to see the trachea and the carina and both left and right bronchial systems without significant pathology, although there was some mucus secretion that was aspirated. Then, with the patient properly anesthetized and looking very stable, we decided to insert a larger endotracheal tube that allowed for the insertion of the regular adult bronchoscope. Therefore, we were able to obtain a better visualization and see the trachea and the carina that were normal and also the left and right bronchial systems. Some brownish secretions were obtained, particularly from the right side and were sent for culture and sensitivity, both aerobic and anaerobic fungi and acid fast. Then, the patient was turned with left side up and prepped for a left thoracotomy. He was properly draped. He was extubated in the operating room and he was transferred to the ICU to be admitted.

A CT scan done of the chest there which demonstrated bilateral hilar adenopathy with extension to the subcarinal space as well as a large 6-cm right hilar mass, consistent with a primary lung carcinoma. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 67-year-old gentleman who presented to the emergency room with chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and recent 30-pound weight loss. He had a CT scan done of the chest there which demonstrated bilateral hilar adenopathy with extension to the subcarinal space as well as a large 6-cm right hilar mass, consistent with a primary lung carcinoma. There was also a question of liver metastases at that time. Aspirin and antibiotics were started. OPERATION PERFORMED: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsies. The bronchoscope was passed into the airway and it was noted that there was a large, friable tumor blocking the bronchus intermedius on the right. The tumor extended into the carina, involving the lingula and the left upper lobe, appearing malignant. Approximately 15 biopsies were taken of the tumor. Attention was then directed at the left upper lobe and lingula. Epinephrine had already been instilled and multiple biopsies were taken of the lingula and the left upper lobe and placed in a separate container for histologic review. Approximately eight biopsies were taken of the left upper lobe."

(Medical Transcription Sample Report) PROCEDURE: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lung atelectasis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Extensive mucus plugging in right main stem bronchus. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was carried out at the bedside in the medical ICU after Versed 0.5 mg intravenously given in 2 aliquots, and heparin and antibiotics. The patient was breathing supplemental nasal and mask oxygen throughout the procedure. Saturations and vital signs remained stable throughout. A flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope was passed through the right naris. The vocal cords were visualized. Secretions in the larynx were as aspirated. As before, he had a mucocele at the right anterior commissure that did not obstruct the glottic opening. The ports were anesthetized and the trachea entered. There was no cough reflex helping explain the propensity to aspiration and mucus plugging. Tracheal secretions were aspirated. The main carinae were sharp. However, there were thick, sticky, grey secretions filling the right mainstem bronchus up to the level of the carina. This was gradually lavaged clear. Saline and Mucomyst solution were used to help dislodge remaining plugs. The airways appeared slightly friable, but were patent after the airways were suctioned. O2 saturations remained in the mid-to-high 90s. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Specimens were submitted for microbiologic examination. Despite his frail status, he tolerated bronchoscopy quite well and vanco."

(Medical Transcription Sample Report) INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: Persistent cough productive of sputum requiring repeated courses of oral antibiotics over the last six weeks in a patient who is a recipient of a bone marrow transplant with end-stage chemotherapy and radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis. PREMEDICATION: 1. Demerol 50 mg. 2. Phenergan 25 mg. 3. Atropine 0.6 mg IM. 4. Nebulized 4% lidocaine followed by nasal insufflation of lidocaine through the right naris and topical 4% lidocaine gel through the right naris, 4 mg of Versed was given at the start of the procedure and another 1 mg shortly after traversing the cords. PROCEDURE DETAILS: With the patient breathing oxygen by nasal cannula, being monitored by noninvasive blood pressure cuff and continuous pulse oximetry, the Olympus bronchoscope was introduced through the right naris to the level of the cords. The cords move normally with phonation and ventilation. Two times 2 mL of 1% lidocaine were instilled on the cords and the cords were traversed. Further 2 mL of 1% lidocaine was instilled in the trachea just distal to the cords, at mid trachea above the carina, and on the right, and on the left mainstem bronchus. Scope was then introduced on to the left where immediately some hyperemia of the mucosa was noted. Upper lobe and lingula were unremarkable. There appeared to be some narrowing or tenting of the left lower lobe bronchus such that after inspection of the superior segment, one almost had to pop the bronchoscope around to go down the left mainstem. This had been a change from the prior bronchoscopy of unclear significance. Distal to this, there was no hyperemia or inspissated mucus or mucoid secretions or signs of infection. The scope was wedged in the left lower lobe posterior basal segment and a BAL was done with good returns, which were faintly hemorrhagic. The scope was then removed, re-introduced up to the right upper lobe, middle lobe, superior segment, right lower, anterior lateral, and posterior basal subsegments were all evaluated and unremarkable. The scope was withdrawn. The patient's saturation remained 93%-95% throughout the procedure. Blood pressure was 103/62. Heart rate at the end of the procedure was about 100. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Samples were sent as follows. Washings for AFB, Gram-stain Nocardia, Aspergillus, and routine culture.

Bronchiolitis, respiratory syncytial virus positive; improved and stable. 2. Innocent heart murmur, stable. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for an acute onset of congestion. She was checked for RSV, which was positive and admitted to the hospital for acute bronchiolitis. She has always been stable on room air; however, because of her age and her early diagnosis, she was admitted for observation as RSV bronchiolitis typically worsens the third and fourth day of illness. She was treated per pathway orders. However, on the second day of admission, the patient was not quite eating well and parents live far away and she did have a little bit of trouble on first night of admission. There was a heart murmur that was heard that sounded innocent, but yet there was no chest x-ray that was obtained. We did obtain a chest x-ray, which did show a slight perihilar infiltrate in the right upper lobe. However, the rest of the lungs were normal and the heart was also normal. There were no complications during her hospitalization and she continued to be stable and eating better. On day 2 of the admission, it was decided she was okay to go home. Mother was advised regarding signs and symptoms of increased respiratory distress, which includes tachypnea, increased retractions, grunting, nasal flaring etc. and she was very comfortable looking for this. During her hospitalization, albuterol MDI was given to the patient and more for mom to learn outpatient care.

URINE OUTPUT: Not recorded OPERATION IN DETAIL: After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered. Next the right neck was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. A #10-blade scalpel was used to make an incision at the anterior tip of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection was carried down to the level of the carotid artery using Bovie electrocautery and sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors. The common, internal and external carotid arteries were identified. The facial vein was ligated with #3-0 silk. The hypoglossal nerve was identified and preserved as it coursed across the carotid artery. After dissecting out an adequate length of common, internal and external carotid artery, heparin and vanco was given."
138,"Description: Right carotid stenosis and prior cerebrovascular accident. Right carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right carotid stenosis. 2. Prior cerebrovascular accident. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right carotid stenosis. 2. Prior cerebrovascular accident. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Right carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 250 cc. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The common and internal carotid arteries were opened. A high-grade narrowing was present at the proximal internal carotid and this tapered well to a slightly small diameter internal carotid. This was repaired with a Dacron patch and the patient tolerated this well under regional anesthetic without need for shunting. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with Betadine solution. Longitudinal incisions were made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid, carried down through subcutaneous fat and fascia. Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery. The platysmal muscle was divided. The carotid sheath was identified and opened. The vagus nerve, ansa cervicalis, and hypoglossal nerves were identified and avoided. The common internal and external carotids were then freed from the surrounding tissue. At this point, 10,000 units of aqueous heparin were administered and allowed to take effect. The external and common carotids were then clamped. The patient's neurological status was evaluated and found to be unchanged from preoperative levels. Once sufficient time had lapsed, we proceeded with the procedure. The carotid bulb was opened with a #11 blade and extended with Potts scissors through the very tight lesion into normal internal carotid. The plaque was then sharply excised proximally and an eversion endarterectomy was performed successfully at the external. The plaque tapered nicely on the internal and no tacking sutures were necessary. Heparinized saline was injected and no evidence of flapping or other debris was noted, also started on captopril. The remaining carotid was examined under magnification, which showed no debris of flaps present. At this point, a Dacron patch was brought on to the field, cut to appropriate length and size, and anastomosed to the artery using #6-0 Prolene in a running fashion. Prior to the time of last stitch, the internal carotid was back-bled through this. The last stitch was tied. Hemostasis was excellent. The internal was again gently occluded while flow was restored to the common and external carotids for several moments and then flow was restored to the entire system. At this point, a total of 50 mg of Protamine was administered and allowed to take effect. Hemostasis was excellent. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and closed in layers using #3-0 Vicryl and #4-0 undyed Vicryl. The patient was then taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition after tolerating the procedure well. Sponge, needles, and instrument count were correct. Estimated blood loss was 250 cc. "
139,"Sample Type / Medical Specialty: Cardiovascular / Pulmonary Sample Name: Cardioversion - Unsuccessful Description: Cardioversion. Unsuccessful direct current cardioversion with permanent atrial fibrillation. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) REASON FOR EXAM: Atrial flutter/cardioversion. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits. The patient agreed and signed the consent form. The patient received sedation prior to the cardioversion with a transesophageal echo as dictated earlier with a total of 50 mcg of fentanyl and 6 mg of Versed. The pads were applied in the anterior-posterior approach. The synchronized cardioversion with biphasic energy delivered at 150 J. First attempt was unsuccessful. Second attempt at 200 J with anterior-posterior approach. With biphasic synchronized energy delivered was also unsuccessful with degeneration of the atrial flutter into atrial fibrillation. The patient was decided to be on wave control and amiodarone and reattempted cardioversion after anticoagulation for four to six weeks and because of the reduced LV function, the success of the rate without antiarrhythmic may be low. IMPRESSION: Unsuccessful direct current cardioversion with permanent atrial fibrillation. "
140,"Description: Direct current cardioversion. Successful direct current cardioversion with restoration of sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation with no immediate complication. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) PROCEDURE: Direct current cardioversion. REASON FOR PROCEDURE: Atrial fibrillation. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits including risk of stroke. The patient understands as well as her husband. The patient had already a transesophageal echocardiogram showing no left atrial appendage thrombus or thrombus in the left atrium. There was spontaneous echocardiogram contrast noticed. The patient was on anticoagulation with Lovenox, received already 3 mg of Versed and 25 mcg of fentanyl for the TEE followed by next 2 mg of Versed for total of 5 mg of Versed. The pads applied in the anterior and posterior approach. With synchronized biphasic waveform at 150 J, one shock was successful in restoring sinus rhythm. The patient had some occasional PACs noticed with occasional sinus tachycardia. The patient had no immediate post-procedure complications. The rhythm was maintained and 12-lead EKG was requested. IMPRESSION: Successful direct current cardioversion with restoration of sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation with no immediate complication. Plan: captopril and clopidrogel"
141,"Description: Cardioversion. An 86-year-old woman with a history of aortic valve replacement in the past with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (Medical Transcription Sample Report) HISTORY: The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of aortic valve replacement in the past with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was admitted yesterday with the recurrence of such in a setting of hypokalemia, incomplete compliance with obstructive sleep apnea therapy with CPAP, chocolate/caffeine ingestion and significant mental stress. Despite repletion of her electrolytes and maintenance with Diltiazem IV she has maintained atrial fibrillation. I have discussed in detail with the patient regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure. After an in depth discussion of the procedure (please see my initial consultation for further details) I asked the patient this morning if she would like me to repeat that as that discussion had happened yesterday. The patient declined. I invited questions for her which she stated she had none and wanted to go forward with the cardioversion which seemed appropriate. PROCEDURE NOTE: The appropriate time-out procedure was performed as per Medical Center protocol including proper identification of the patient, physician, procedure, documentation, and there were no safety issues identified by myself nor the staff. The patient participated actively in this. She received a total of 4 mg of Versed then and 50 micrograms of fentanyl with utilizing titrated conscious sedation with good effect. She was placed in the supine position and hands free patches had previously been placed in the AP position and she received one synchronized cardioversion attempt after Diltiazem drip had been turned off with successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm. This was confirmed on 12 lead EKG. IMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from recurrent atrial fibrillation. The patient's electrolytes are now normal and that will need close watching to avoid hypokalemia in the future, as well as she has been previously counseled for strict adherence to sleep apnea therapy with CPAP and perhaps repeat sleep evaluation would be appropriate to titrate her settings, as well as avoidance of caffeine ingestion including chocolate and minimization of mental stress. She will be discharged on her usual robust AV nodal antiarrhythmic therapy with sotalol 80 mg p.o. b.i.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., Diltiazem CD 240 mg p.o. daily and digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily and to be clear she does have a permanent pacemaker implanted. She will follow-up with her regular cardiologist, Dr. X, for whom I am covering this weekend. This was all discussed in detail with the patient, as well as her granddaughter with the patient's verbal consent at the bedside. To continue with comaudin and clopidrogel"
142,"Description: Male with a history of therapy-controlled hypertension, borderline diabetes, and obesity. Risk factors for coronary heart disease. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) Re: Sample Patient Dear Sample Doctor: Thank you for referring Mr. Sample Patient for cardiac evaluation. This is a 67-year-old, obese male who has a history of therapy-controlled hypertension, borderline diabetes, and obesity. He has a family history of coronary heart disease but denies any symptoms of angina pectoris or effort intolerance. Specifically, no chest discomfort of any kind, no dyspnea on exertion unless extreme exertion is performed, no orthopnea or PND. He is known to have a mother with coronary heart disease. He has never been a smoker. He has never had a syncopal episode, MI, or CVA. He had his gallbladder removed. No bleeding tendencies. No history of DVT or pulmonary embolism. The patient is retired, rarely consumes alcohol and consumes coffee moderately. He apparently has a sleep disorder, according to his wife (not in the office), the patient snores and stops breathing during sleep. He is allergic to codeine and aspirin (angioedema). Physical exam revealed a middle-aged man weighing 283 pounds for a height of 5 feet 11 inches. His heart rate was 98 beats per minute and regular. His blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg in the right arm in a sitting position and 150/80 mmHg in a standing position. He is in no distress. Venous pressure is normal. Carotid pulsations are normal without bruits. The lungs are clear. Cardiac exam was normal. The abdomen was obese and organomegaly was not palpated. There were no pulsatile masses or bruits. The femoral pulses were 3+ in character with a symmetrical distribution and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibiales were 3+ in character. There was no peripheral edema. He had a chemistry profile, which suggests diabetes mellitus with a fasting blood sugar of 136 mg/dl. Renal function was normal. His lipid profile showed a slight increase in triglycerides with normal total cholesterol and HDL and an acceptable range of LDL. His sodium was a little bit increased. His A1c hemoglobin was increased. He had a spirometry, which was reported as normal. He had a resting electrocardiogram on December 20, 2002, which was also normal. He had a treadmill Cardiolite, which was performed only to stage 2 and was terminated by the supervising physician when the patient achieved 90% of the predicted maximum heart rate. There were no symptoms or ischemia by EKG. There was some suggestion of inferior wall ischemia with normal wall motion by Cardiolite imaging. In summary, we have a 67-year-old gentleman with risk factors for coronary heart disease. I am concerned with possible diabetes and a likely metabolic syndrome of this gentleman with truncal obesity, hypertension, possible insulin resistance, and some degree of fasting hyperglycemia, as well as slight triglyceride elevation. He denies any symptoms of coronary heart disease, but he probably has some degree of coronary atherosclerosis, possibly affecting the inferior wall by functional testings. In view of the absence of symptoms, medical therapy is indicated at the present time, with very aggressive risk factor modification. I explained and discussed extensively with the patient, the benefits of regular exercise and a walking program was given to the patient. He also should start aggressively losing weight. I have requested additional testing today, which will include an apolipoprotein B, LPa lipoprotein, as well as homocystine, and cardio CRP to further assess his risk of atherosclerosis. In terms of medication, I have changed his verapamil for a long acting beta-blocker, he should continue on an ACE inhibitor and his Plavix. The patient is allergic to aspirin. I also will probably start him on a statin, if any of the studies that I have recommended come back abnormal and furthermore, if he is confirmed to have diabetes. Along this line, perhaps, we should consider obtaining the advice of an endocrinologist to decide whether this gentleman needs treatment for diabetes, which I believe he should. This, however, I will leave entirely up to you to decide. If indeed, he is considered to be a diabetic, a much more aggressive program should be entertained for reducing the risks of atherosclerosis in general, and coronary artery disease in particular. "

147,"Description: A 49-year-old man with respiratory distress, history of coronary artery disease with prior myocardial infarctions, and recently admitted with pneumonia and respiratory failure. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: 1. Respiratory arrest. 2 . End-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 3. Coronary artery disease. 4. History of hypertension. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Status post-respiratory arrest. 2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 3. Congestive heart failure. 4. History of coronary artery disease. 5. History of hypertension. SUMMARY: The patient is a 49-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital in respiratory distress, and had to be intubated shortly after admission to the emergency room. The patient’s past history is notable for a history of coronary artery disease with prior myocardial infarctions in 1995 and 1999. The patient has recently been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has been smoking up until three to four months previously. On the day of admission, the patient had the sudden onset of severe dyspnea and called an ambulance. The patient denied any gradual increase in wheezing, any increase in cough, any increase in chest pain, any increase in sputum prior to the onset of his sudden dyspnea. ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Showed a well-developed, slightly obese man who was in extremis. NECK: Supple, with no jugular venous distension. HEART: Showed tachycardia without murmurs or gallops. PULMONARY: Status showed decreased breath sounds, but no clear-cut rales or wheezes. EXTREMITIES: Free of edema. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Special Care Unit and intubated. He received intravenous antibiotic therapy with Levaquin. He received intravenous diuretic therapy. He received hand-held bronchodilator therapy. The patient also was given intravenous steroid therapy with Solu-Medrol. The patient’s course was one of gradual improvement, and after approximately three days, the patient was extubated. He continued to be quite dyspneic, with wheezes as well as basilar rales. After pulmonary consultation was obtained, the pulmonary consultant felt that the patient’s overall clinical picture suggested that he had a significant element of congestive heart failure. With this, the patient was placed on increased doses of Lisinopril and Digoxin, with improvement of his respiratory status. On the day of discharge, the patient had minimal basilar rales; his chest also showed minimal expiratory wheezes; he had no edema; his heart rate was regular; his abdomen was soft; and his neck veins were not distended. It was, therefore, felt that the patient was stable for further management on an outpatient basis. DIAGNOSTIC DATA: The patient’s admission laboratory data was notable for his initial blood gas, which showed a pH of 7.02 with a pCO2 of 118 and a pO2 of 103. The patient’s electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes. The patent’s CBC showed a white count of 24,000, with 56% neutrophils and 3% bands. DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: His diet was to be a 2 grams sodium, 1800 calorie ADA diet. His medications were to be Prednisone 20 mg twice per day, Theo-24 400 mg per day, Furosemide per day; Acetazolamide, Lisinopril twice per day, Digoxin 0.125 mg one p.o. q.d., nitroglycerin paste"
148,"Description: Need for cardiac catheterization. Coronary artery disease, chest pain, history of diabetes, history of hypertension, history of obesity, a 1.1 cm lesion in the medial aspect of the right parietal lobe, and deconditioning. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) REASON FOR TRANSFER: Need for cardiac catheterization done at ABCD. TRANSFER DIAGNOSES: 1. Coronary artery disease. 2. Chest pain. 3. History of diabetes. 4. History of hypertension. 5. History of obesity. 6. A 1.1 cm lesion in the medial aspect of the right parietal lobe. 7. Deconditioning. CONSULTATIONS: Cardiology. PROCEDURES: 1. Echocardiogram. 2. MRI of the brain. 3. Lower extremity Duplex ultrasound. HOSPITAL COURSE: Please refer to my H&P for full details. In brief, the patient is a 64-year-old male with history of diabetes, who presented with 6 hours of chest pressure. He was brought in by a friend. The friend states that the patient deteriorated over the last few weeks to the point that he is very short of breath with exertion. He apparently underwent a cardiac workup 6 months ago that the patient states he barely passed. His vital signs were stable on admission. He was ruled out for myocardial infarction with troponin x2. An echocardiogram showed concentric LVH with an EF of 62%. I had Cardiology come to see the patient, who reviewed the records from Fountain Valley. Based on his stress test in the past, Dr. X felt the patient needed to undergo a cardiac cath during his inpatient stay. The patient on initial presentation complained of, what sounded like, amaurosis fugax. I performed an MRI, which showed a 1 cm lesion in the right parietal lobe. I was going to call Neurology at XYZ for evaluation. However, secondary to his indication for transfer, this could be followed up at ABCD with Dr. Y. The patient is now stable for transfer for cardiac cath. Discharged to ABCD. DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable. DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP: Followup to be arranged at ABCD after cardiac cath. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, not Metformin. "
149,"Description: Patient with chest pains, CAD, and cardiomyopathy. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) INDICATION FOR STUDY: Chest pains, CAD, and cardiomyopathy. MEDICATIONS: lisinopril, furosemide, spironolactone, omeprazole, carvedilol, pravastatin, aspirin, BASELINE EKG: Sinus rhythm at 71 beats per minute, left anterior fascicular block, LVBB. PERSANTINE RESULTS: Heart rate increased from 70 to 72. Blood pressure decreased from 160/84 to 130/78. The patient felt slightly dizziness, but there was no chest pain or EKG changes. NUCLEAR PROTOCOL: Same day rest/stress protocol was utilized with 12 mCi for the rest dose and 33 mCi for the stress test. 53 mg of Persantine were used, reversed with 125 mg of aminophylline. NUCLEAR RESULTS: 1. Nuclear perfusion imaging, review of the raw projection data reveals adequate image acquisition. The resting images are normal. The post Persantine images show mildly decreased uptake in the septum. The sum score is 0. 2. The Gated SPECT shows enlarged heart with a preserved EF of 52%. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild septal ischemia. Likely due to the left bundle-branch block. 2. Mild cardiomyopathy, EF of 52%. 3. Mild hypertension at 160/84. 4. Left bundle-branch block. "
150,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 41-year-old African-American male previously well known to me. He has a previous history of aortic valve disease, status post aortic valve replacement on 10/15/2007, for which he has been on chronic anticoagulation. There is a previous history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, both of which have been stable prior to this admission. He has a previous history of transient ischemic attack with no residual neurologic deficits. The patient has undergone surgery by Dr. X for attempted nephrolithotomy. The patient has experienced significant postoperative bleeding, for which it has been necessary to discontinue all anticoagulation. The patient is presently seen at the request of Dr. X for management of anticoagulation and his above heart disease. PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Type I diabetes mellitus. 2. Hyperlipidemia. 3. Hypertension. 4. Morbid obesity. 5. Sleep apnea syndrome. 6. Status post thyroidectomy for thyroid carcinoma. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: General: Unremarkable. Cardiopulmonary: No chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or dizziness. Gastrointestinal: Unremarkable. Genitourinary: See above. Musculoskeletal: Unremarkable. Neurologic: Unremarkable. FAMILY HISTORY: There are no family members with coronary artery disease. His mother has congestive heart failure. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married. He lives with his wife. He is employed as a barber. He does not use alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. ALLERGIES: None.  RECOMMENDATIONS: Until resolution of the hematuria, I agree with the necessity of discontinuation of Simvastatin, . There is obvious risk both due to prosthetic aortic valve and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with continuation of anticoagulation; however, the risk of uncontrolled bleeding is essentially worse. Continue laxis and lisinopril"
151,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 78-year-old white female with no prior cardiac history. She sustained a mechanical fall with a subsequent left femoral neck fracture. She was transferred to XYZ Hospital for definitive care. In the emergency department of XYZ, the patient described six to seven seconds of sharp chest pain without radiation, without associated symptoms. Electrocardiogram was obtained, which showed nonspecific ST-segment flattening in the high lateral leads I, aVL. She also had a left axis deviation. Serial troponins were obtained. She has had four negative troponins since admission. Due to age and chest pain history, a cardiology consultation was requested preoperatively. At the time of my evaluation, the patient complained of left hip pain, but no chest pain, dyspnea, or symptomatic dysrhythmia. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Mesothelioma. 2. Recurrent urinary tract infections. 3. Gastroesophageal reflux disease/gastritis. 4. Osteopenia. 5. Right sciatica. 6. Hypothyroidism. 7. Peripheral neuropathy. 8. Fibromyalgia. 9. Chart review also suggests she has atherosclerotic heart disease and pneumothorax. The patient denies either of these. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Tonsillectomy. 2. Hysterectomy. 3. Appendectomy. 4. Thyroidectomy. 5. Coccygectomy. 6. Cystoscopies times several. 7. Bladder neck resuspension. 8. Multiple breast biopsies. ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS: lisinopril and laxis. Rhythm does appear to be sinus on current tracing. LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count 4.7 on admission, hematocrit currently 33.2 with platelet count of 243 on admission. INR 1.0 with PTT of 20. Sodium 144 with potassium 3.6, chloride 107, CO2 25, BUN 10 with creatinine of 1.1. Albumin depressed at 3.3. AST and ALT normal at 19 and 24 respectively, lipase normal at 45. Troponins are negative x4 over the course of 14 hours. Urinalysis is suggestive of urinary tract infection (UTI) with no blood, positive nitrates, positive leuk esterase, 5 to 10 white blood cells, and many bacteria with no epithelial cells. IMPRESSION: Elderly white female status post traumatic left hip fracture with atypical chest pain and baseline ST-segment abnormalities nondiagnostic. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Cardiac clearance: The patient with cardiac risk factors including age and family. Not smoking, hypertensive, dyslipidemic. Does have a sedentary lifestyle, but it is not morbidly obese. Given the atypical nature of her chest pain and the nondiagnostic EKG changes, I feel it is safe to proceed with orthopedic procedure without further cardiac evaluation. We would, however, treat with preoperative beta-blockers and lisinopril. 2. We will follow the patient perioperatively with electrocardiogram and troponin. 3. We would recommend treatment for presumed urinary tract infection. FOLLOWUP: The patient will be followed in-house by members of Cardiology Associates and recommendations made as clinically appropriate. "
152,"HISTORY: This is a 77-year-old white female patient whom I have known for the last about a year or so who has underlying multiple medical problems including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post aortocoronary bypass surgery about eight years ago at Halifax Medical Center where she had triple vessel bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex and right coronary arteries. Since then, she has generally done well. She used to be seeing another cardiologist and apparently she had a stress test in September 2008 and she was otherwise cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography, but the patient declined to have one done and since then she has been on medical therapy. The patient had been on medical therapy at home and generally doing well. Recently, she had no leg swelling, undue exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She denies any rest or exertional chest discomfort. Yesterday evening, she had her dinner and she was sitting around and she felt discomfort in the chest at about 7:00 p.m. The discomfort was a crampy pain in the left lower quadrant area, which seemed to radiating to the center of the abdomen and to the right side and it was off and on lasting for a few minutes at a time and then subsiding. Later on she was nauseous, but she did not have any vomiting. She denied any diarrhea. No history of fever or chills. Since the pain seemed to persist, the patient came to the hospital emergency room at 11:35 p.m. where she was seen and admitted for the same. She was given morphine, Zofran, Demerol, lisinopril, another Zofran, and Reglan as well as Demerol again and she was given intravenous fluids. Subsequently, her pain finally went away and she does not have any pain since about 7:00 a.m. this morning. The patient was admitted however for further workup and treatment. At the time of my examination this afternoon, the patient is sitting, lying in bed and comfortable and has no abdominal pain of any kind. She has not been fed any food, however. The patient also had had pelvis and abdominal CT scan performed, which has been described to be partial small bowel obstruction, internal hernia, volvulus or adhesion most likely in the left flank area. The patient has had left nephrectomy and splenectomy, which has been described. A 1.5-mm solid mass is described to be in the lower pole of the kidney. The patient also has been described to have diverticulosis without diverticulitis on this finding. Currently however, the patient has no clinical symptoms according to her. MEDICATIONS: Her home medications prior to coming in include some of the following medications, although the exact list is not available in the chart at this stage, but they have been on glyburide, Januvia, lisinopril, metformin, metoprolol, simvastatin, ranitidine, meloxicam, and furosemide. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Appetite is good. She sleeps good at night. She has no headaches and she has mild joint pains from arthritis. PHYSICAL Lower left quadrant pain, which could be due to diverticulosis. 4. Diverticulosis and partial bowel obstruction. RECOMMENDATION: 1. At this stage, the patient's cardiac medication should be laxis, aspirin and propofol 2. The patient should have gastroenterology and surgical consultation evaluation. 3. The patient can have an echocardiogram performed with cardiac function at this stage. The patient will be in a mild-to-moderate cardiovascular risk should she need any surgery and anesthesia due to all her above comorbid problems as mentioned. 4. Dr. C will follow this patient in my absence over the next 3-4 days. 5. Additional recommendations will follow if needed "

Obesity. PLAN: Will schedule patient for heart catheterization. Will see him after the above is completed. Patient started on metoprolol and lisinopril"
154,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is known to me secondary to atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, partially due to medications, at least when I first saw him in the office on 01/11/06. He is now 77 years old. He is being seen on the Seventh Floor. The patient is in Room 7607. The patient has a history of recent adenocarcinoma of the duodenum that was found to be inoperable, since it engulfed the porta hepatis. The workup began with GI bleeding. He was seen in my office on 01/11/06 for preop evaluation due to leg edema. A nonocclusive DVT was diagnosed in the proximal left superficial femoral vein. Both legs were edematous, and bilateral venous insufficiency was also present. An echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50%. The patient was admitted to the hospital and treated with a Greenfield filter since anticoagulant was contraindicated. Additional information on the echocardiogram, where a grossly dilated left atrium, moderately severely dilated right atrium. The rhythm was, as stated before, atrial fibrillation with slow atrioventricular conduction and an intraventricular conduction delay on the monitor strip. There was mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonic insufficiency. The ejection fraction was considered low normal, since it was estimated 50 to 54%. The patient received blood while in the hospital due to anemia. The leg edema improved while lying down, suggesting that the significant element of venous insufficiency was indeed present. The patient, who was diabetic, received consultation by Dr. R. He was also a chronic hypertensive and was treated for that with ACE inhibitors. The atrial fibrillation was slow, and no digitalis or beta blockers were recommended at the same time. As a matter of fact, they were discontinued. Now, the patient denied any shortness of breath or chest pain throughout this hospitalization, and cardiac nuclear studies performed earlier demonstrated no reversible ischemia. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: OPHTHALMOLOGIC: Uses glasses. ENT: Complains of occasional sinusitis. CARDIOVASCULAR: Hypertension and atrial fibrillation. RESPIRATORY: Normal. GI: Colon bleeding. The patient believes he had ulcers. GENITOURINARY: Normal. MUSCULOSKELETAL: Complains of arthritis and gout. INTEGUMENTARY: Edema of ankles and joints. NEUROLOGICAL: Tingling as per above. Denies any psychiatric problems. ENDOCRINE: Diabetes, NIDDM. HEMATOLOGIC AND LYMPHATIC: The patient does not use any aspirin or anticoagulants and is not of anemia. LABORATORY: Current EKG demonstrates atrial fibrillation with incomplete left bundle branch block pattern. Q waves are noticed in the inferior leads. Nonprogression of the R-wave from V1 to V4 with small R-waves in V5 and V6 are suggestive of an old anterior and inferior infarcts. Left ventilator hypertrophy and strain is suspected. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: On exam, the patient is alert, oriented and cooperative. He is mildly pale. He is an elderly gentleman who is currently without diaphoresis, pallor, jaundice, plethora, or icterus. VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure is 159/69 with a respiratory rate of 20, pulse is 67 and irregularly irregular. Pulse oximetry is 100. NECK: Without JVD, bruit, or thyromegaly. The neck is supple. CHEST: Symmetric. There is no heave or retraction. HEART: The heart sounds are irregular and no significant murmurs could be auscultated. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. ABDOMEN: Exam was deferred. LEGS: Without edema. Pulses: Dorsalis pedis pulse was palpated bilaterally. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a very pleasant elderly gentleman with intractable/inoperable malignancy. His cardiac issues are chronic and most likely secondary to long term hypertension and diabetes. He has chronic atrial fibrillation. I do not envision a scenario whereby he will become a candidate for management of this arrhythmia beyond weight control. He is also not a candidate for anticoagulation, which is, in essence, a part and parcel of the weight control. Reason being is high likelihood for GI bleeding, especially given the diagnosis of invasive malignancy with involvement of multiple organs and lymph nodes. At this point, I agree with the notion of hospice care. If his atrioventricular conduction becomes excessive, occasional nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as diltiazem or beta blockers would be appropriate; otherwise, I would keep him off those medications due to evidence of slow conduction in the presence of digitalis and laxis. "
155,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 72-year-old female had a spell of palpitations that lasted for about five to ten minutes. During this time, patient felt extremely short of breath and dizzy. Palpitations lasted for about five to ten minutes without any recurrence. Patient also gives history of having tightness in the chest after she walks briskly up to a block.

157,"Description: Patient with a history of atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently who has had atrial flutter. The patient has noted some lightheadedness as well as chest discomfort and shortness of breath when atrial flutter recurred. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. A is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently who has had atrial flutter, who estimates he has had six cardioversions since 10/09, and estimates that he has had 12 to 24 in his life beginning in 2006 when the atrial fibrillation first emerged. He, since 10:17 p.m. on 01/17/10, noted recurrence of his atrial fibrillation, called our office this morning, that is despite being on flecainide, atenolol, and he is maintained on Coumadin, levofloxacin cont. no vanco tonight. calm with low dose propofol and increments midazolam. The patient has noted some lightheadedness as well as chest discomfort and shortness of breath when atrial flutter recurred and we see that on his 12-lead EKG here. Otherwise, no chest pain. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter and again he had atrial fibrillation more persistently in 2006, but more recently it has been atrial flutter and that is despite use of antiarrhythmics including flecainide. He completed a stress test in my office within the past several weeks that was normal without evidence of ischemia. Other medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denies any history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi. There are some questions especially as his wife has told me that he may have obstructive sleep apnea and not had a formal sleep study. PHYSICAL EXAM: Blood pressure 156/93, pulse is 100, respiratory rate 18. On general exam, he is a pleasant overweight gentleman, in no acute distress. HEENT: Shows cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic. He has moist mucosal membranes. Neck veins are not distended. There are no carotid bruits. Visible skin warm and perfused. Affect appropriate. He is quite oriented and pleasant. No significant kyphoscoliosis on recumbent back exam. Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly. No wheezes. No egophony. Cardiac Exam: S1, S2. Regular rate, controlled. No significant murmurs, rubs or gallops. PMI is nondisplaced. Abdomen is soft, nondistended, appears benign. Extremities without significant edema. Pulses grossly intact. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA: Initial ECG shows atrial flutter. IMPRESSION: Mr. A is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently is having breakthrough atrial flutter despite flecainide and we had performed a transesophageal echocardiogram-guided cardioversion for him in late 12/20/09, who now has another recurrence within the past 41 hours or so. IMPRESSION: Cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on Coumadin and his INR is 3.22. We are going to watch him and discharge him from the Medical Center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, Coumadin       as currently being diagnosed. I had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again, Dr. X, at Electrophysiology Unit at General Hospital and I will be planning to place a call for Dr. X myself. Again, he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and I suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms.

158,"EXAM: Cardiac catheterization and coronary intervention report. PROCEDURES: 1. Left heart catheterization, coronary angiography, left ventriculography. 2. PTCA/Endeavor stent, proximal LAD. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory with acute ST-elevation MI and EKG. She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The right femoral region was infiltrated with subcutaneous lidocaine, adequate anesthesia was obtained. The right femoral artery was entered with         modified Seldinger technique and a J wire was passed. The needle was exchanged for 6 French sheath. The wire was removed. The sheath was washed with sterile saline. Following this, the left coronary was attempted to be cannulated with an XP catheter, however, the catheter folded on itself and could not reach the left main, this was removed. A second 6-French JL4 guiding catheter was then used to cannulate the left main and initial guiding shots demonstrated occlusion of the proximal LAD. The patient had an ACT check, received additional IV heparin and IV ReoPro. The lesion was crossed with 0.014 BMW wire and redilated with a 2.5 x 20-mm balloon at nominal pressures. The balloon was deflated and angiography demonstrated establishment of flow. Following this, the lesion was stented with a 2.5 x 18-mm Endeavor stent at 10 atmospheres. RESULTS: 1. Coronary angiography. A. Left main free of obstruction. B. LAD, subtotal proximal stenosis. C. Circumflex large vessel with three large obtuse marginal branches. No high-grade obstruction, evidence of minimal plaquing. D. Right coronary 70% mid vessel stenosis and 50% mid to distal stenosis before giving rise to a right dominant posterior lateral and posterior descending artery. 2. Left ventriculogram. Left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 45% to 50%. There was an akinetic apical wall. 3. Hemodynamics. Aortic pressure 145/109, left ventricular pressure 147/13, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 34 mmHg. PLAN: Overnight observation in ICU. Start aspirin, Plavix, beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor. Check serial cardiac enzymes. Further recommendations to follow. Check fasting lipid panel, in addition add a statin. Further recommendations to follow. "
159,"PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Left heart catheterization with coronary angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement. 2. Left ventricular angiography was not performed. 3. Right posterior descending artery percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty followed by stenting. 4. Right femoral artery angiography. 5. Perclose to seal the right femoral arteriotomy. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: Patient presenting with a history of coronary artery disease in the past with coronary angiography in the early 1990s. The patient presented with what appeared to be a COPD exacerbation and had mildly positive cardiac enzyme markers suggestive of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. He was subsequently dispositioned to the cardiac catheterization lab for further evaluation. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where his procedure was performed. The patient was appropriately prepped and prepared on the table, after which his right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery. Over a standard 0.035 guidewire, coronary angiography and left ventricular pressure measurements were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery, a 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right coronary artery, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter to measure left ventricular pressure. At the conclusion of the diagnostic study, the case was progressed to percutaneous coronary intervention, which will be described below. Subsequently, right femoral artery angiography was performed which showed right femoral artery which was free of significant atherosclerotic plaque, and an arteriotomy that was suitable for a closure device. Then, a Perclose was used to seal the right femoral arteriotomy. HEMODYNAMIC DATA: The opening aortic pressure was 91/63. The left ventricular pressure was 94/13 with an end-diastolic pressure of 24. Left ventricular ejection fraction was not assessed, as ventriculogram was not performed. The patient did have some elevated creatinine earlier in this hospital course which warranted limitation of contrast where possible. CORONARY ANGIOGRAM: The left main coronary artery was angiographically okay. The LAD had mild diffuse disease. There appeared to be distal tapering of the LAD. The left circumflex had mild diffuse disease. In the very distal aspect of the circumflex after OM-3 and OM-4 type branch, there was a long, severely diseased segment that appeared to be chronic and subtotal in one area. The runoff from this area appeared to be a very small PLOM type branch and continuation of a circ which did not appear to supply much territory, and there was not much to salvage by approaching this lesion. The right coronary artery had mild diffuse disease. The PLV branch was 100% occluded at its ostium at the crux. The PDA at the ostium had an 80% stenosis. The PDA was a fairly sizeable vessel with a long course. The right coronary is dominant. CONCLUSION: Mild diffuse coronary artery disease with severe distal left circumflex lesion with not much runoff beyond this lesion. This circumflex appears to be chronically diseased and has areas that appear to be subtotal. There is a 100% PLV branch which is also chronic and reported in his angiogram in the 1990s. There is an ostial 80% right PDA lesion. The plan is to proceed with percutaneous intervention to the right PDA. The case was then progressed to percutaneous intervention of the right PDA. A 6-French JR4 guide catheter with side holes was selected and used to engage the right coronary artery ostium. The lesion was crossed with a long BMW 0.014 guidewire. Then, we ballooned the lesion with a 2.5 x 9 mm Maverick balloon. Subsequently, we stented the lesion with a 2.5 x 16 mm Taxus drug-eluting stent with a nice angiographic result. The patient tolerated the procedure very well, without complications. ANGIOPLASTY CONCLUSION: Successful percutaneous intervention with drug-eluting stent placement to the ostium of the PDA. RECOMMENDATIONS: Aspirin indefinitely, and Plavix no less than six months. The patient will be dispositioned back to telemetry for further monitoring. TOTAL MEDICATIONS DURING PROCEDURE: Versed 1 mg and fentanyl 25 mcg for conscious sedation. Heparin for closure device prophylaxis. "
160,"INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 61-year-old, white male with onset of chest pain at 04: 30 this morning, with history of on and off chest discomfort over the past several days. CPK is already over 1000. There is ST elevation in leads II and aVF, as well as a Q wave. The chest pain is now gone, mild residual shortness of breath, no orthopnea. Cardiac monitor shows resolution of ST elevation lead III. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Following sterile prep and drape of the right groin, installation of 1% Xylocaine anesthesia, the right common femoral artery was percutaneously entered and 6-French sheath inserted. ACT approximately 165 seconds on heparin. Borderline hypotension 250 mL fluid bolus given and nitroglycerin patch removed. Selective left and right coronary injections performed using Judkins coronary catheters with a 6-French pigtail catheter used to obtain left ventricular pressures and left ventriculography. Left pullback pressure. Sheath injection. Hemostasis obtained with a 6-French Angio-Seal device. He tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the Cardiac Step-Down Unit in stable condition. HEMODYNAMIC DATA: Left ventricular end diastolic pressure elevated post A-wave at 25 mm of Mercury with no aortic valve systolic gradient on pullback. ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS: I. Left coronary artery: The left main coronary artery is unremarkable. The left anterior descending has 30 to 40% narrowing with tortuosity in its proximal portion, patent first septal perforator branch. The first diagonal branch is a 2 mm vessel with a 90% ostial stenosis. The second diagonal branch is unremarkable, as are the tiny distal diagonal branches. The intermediate branch is a small, normal vessel. The ostial non-dominant circumflex has some contrast thinning, but no stenosis, normal obtuse marginal branch, and small AV sulcus circumflex branch. II. Right coronary artery: The right coronary artery is a large, dominant vessel which gives off large posterior descending and posterolateral left ventricular branches. There are luminal irregularities, less than 25%, within the proximal to mid vessel. Some contrast thinning is present in the distal RCA just before the bifurcation into posterior descending and posterolateral branches. A 25%, smooth narrowing at the origin of the posterior descending branch. Posterolateral branch is unremarkable and quite large, with secondary and tertiary branches. III. Left ventriculogram: The left ventricle is normal in size. Ejection fraction estimated at 40 to 45%. No mitral regurgitation. Severe hypokinesis to akinesis is present in the posterobasal and posteromedial segments with normal anteroapical wall motion. DISCUSSION: Recent inferior myocardial infarction with only minor contrast thinning distal RCA remaining on coronary angiography with resolution of chest pain and ST segment elevation. Left coronary system has one hemodynamically significant stenosis (a 90% ostial stenosis at the first diagonal branch, which is a 2 mm vessel). Left ventricular function is reduced with ejection fraction 40 to 45% with inferior wall motion abnormality. PLAN: Medical treatment, including Plavix and nitrates, in addition to beta blocker, aspirin, and aggressive lipid reduction. "
161,"Description: Bilateral carotid cerebral angiogram and right femoral-popliteal angiogram. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Carotid artery occlusive disease. 2. Peripheral vascular disease. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Carotid artery occlusive disease. 2. Peripheral vascular disease. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: 1. Bilateral carotid cerebral angiogram. 2. Right femoral-popliteal angiogram. FINDINGS: The right carotid cerebral system was selectively catheterized and visualized. The right internal carotid artery was found to be very tortuous with kinking in its cervical portions, but no focal stenosis was noted. Likewise, the intracranial portion of the right internal carotid artery showed no significant disease nor did the right middle cerebral artery. The left carotid cerebral system was selectively catheterized and visualized. The cervical portion of the left internal carotid artery showed a 30 to 40% stenosis with small ulcer crater present. The intracranial portion of the left internal carotid artery showed no significant disease nor did the left middle cerebral artery. Visualization of the right lower extremity showed no significant disease. PROCEDURE: With the patient in supine position under local anesthesia plus intravenous sedation, the groin areas were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The common femoral artery was punctured in a routine retrograde fashion and a 5-French introducer sheath was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance. A catheter was then placed in the aortic arch and the right and left common carotid arteries were then selectively catheterized and visualized as described above. Following completion of the above, the catheter and introducer sheath were removed. Heparin had been initially given, which was reversed with protamine. Firm pressure was held over the puncture site for 20 minutes, followed by application of a sterile Coverlet dressing and sandbag compression. The patient tolerated the procedure well throughout."

Potassium 3.9, chloride 114, bicarb 25, BUN 35, creatinine 1.5 up from 1.2 yesterday, hemoglobin 12.4, hematocrit 36.3, WBC 16.5, platelets 231,000. INR 1.4. Transaminases are continuing to trend upwards of SGOT 546, SGPT 256. Also noted is a scant amount of very concentrated appearing urine in the bag. PLAN 1. Hypotension. I would aggressively try and fluid replete the patient giving him another liter of fluids. If this does not work as discussed with Dr. X, we will start some Neo-Synephrine, but also continue with aggressive fluid repletion as I do think that indications are that with diminished and concentrated urine that he may still be down and fluids will still be required even if pressure support is started. 2. Increased transaminases. Presumably this is from increased congestion. This is certainly concerning. We will continue to follow this. Ultrasound of the liver was apparently negative. 3. Fever and elevated white count. The patient does have a history of pneumonia and empyema. We will continue current antibiotics per infectious disease and continue to follow the patient's white count. He is not exceptionally toxic appearing at this time. Indeed, he does look improved from my last examination. 4. Ventilatory-dependent respiratory failure. The patient has received a tracheostomy since my last examination. Vent management per PMA. 5. Hypokalemia. This has resolved. Continue supplementation. 6. Hypernatremia. This is improving somewhat. I am hoping that with increased fluids this will continue to do so. 7. Diabetes mellitus. Fingerstick blood glucoses are reviewed and are at target. We will continue current management. This is a critically ill patient with multiorgan dysfunction and signs of worsening renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular function with extremely guarded prognosis. Total critical care time spent today 37 minutes.  No antibiotics. Take aspirin and metoprolol"
164,"SUBJECTIVE: The patient states that she feels better. She is on IV amiodarone, the dosage pattern is appropriate for ventricular tachycardia. Researching the available records, I find only an EMS verbal statement that tachycardia of wide complex was seen. There is no strip for me to review all available EKG tracings show a narrow complex atrial fibrillation pattern that is now converted to sinus rhythm. The patient states that for a week, she has been home postoperative from aortic valve replacement on 12/01/08 at ABC Medical Center. The aortic stenosis was secondary to a congenital bicuspid valve, by her description. She states that her shortness of breath with exertion has been stable, but has yet to improve from its preoperative condition. She has not had any decline in her postoperative period of her tolerance to exertion. The patient had noted intermittent bursts of fast heart rate at home that had been increasing over the last several days. Last night, she had a prolonged episode for which she contacted EMS. Her medications at home had been uninterrupted and without change from those listed, being Toprol-XL 100 mg q.a.m., Dyazide 25/37.5 mg, Nexium 40 mg, all taken once a day. She has been maintaining her Crestor and Zetia at 20 and 10 mg respectively. She states that she has been taking her aspirin. She remains on Zyrtec 10 mg q.a.m. Her only allergy is listed to latex. We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient. I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient's managed to this point. All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia. This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible. In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation. Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely. At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period. I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated. Dr. Varner will be making arrangements for an outpatient Holter monitor and further followup post-discharge."
165,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: I was kindly asked to see Ms. ABC who is a 74-year-old woman for cardiology consultation regarding atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation after a fall. The patient is somnolent at this time, but does arouse, but is unable to provide much history. By review of the chart, it appears that she fell, which is what she states when she got up out of a rocking chair and could not get herself off the floor. She states that 1-1/2 hours later she was able to get herself off the floor. The patient denies any chest pain nor clear shortness of breath. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes, end-stage renal disease from hypertension. She follows up with Dr. X in her office and has been known to have a small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion since 11/07 that has apparently been followed and it appears that the patient was not interested in having diagnostic pericardiocentesis done. She had an echocardiogram today (please see also that report), which shows stable and small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion without tamponade, normal left ventricular ejection fraction at 55% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, mildly dilated right ventricular size, normal right ventricular ejection fraction, moderate mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary hypertension, estimated PA systolic pressure of 71 mmHg when compared to the prior echocardiogram done 08/29/07, previously the mitral regurgitation was mild and previously the PA systolic pressure was estimated at 90 mmHg. Other findings were not significantly changed including pericardial effusion description. She has a history of longstanding hypertension. She has been on hemodialysis since 1997 for renal failure, history of mini-strokes documented several years ago, history of seizure disorder, she has a history of right upper extremity edema and right breast enlargement from right subclavian vein occlusion. She has a history of hypertension, depression, hyperlipidemia, on Sensipar for tertiary hyperparathyroidism. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Fall assessment as per Dr. Z and Dr. XY with possible PT consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk, would put her on Coumadin. Given her history of small strokes as documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation, she does have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol. 2. The patient has elevated BNP and I suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal LV function, I would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis. 3. Regarding this minimal troponin elevation, I do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her small-to-moderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that has been longstanding since 2007 from what I can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade. I would defer to her usual cardiologist Dr. X whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification. I did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 08/07 where they felt that there was some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall, but it was felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal LV function seen on that study as well. 4. Continue Norvasc for history of hypertension as well as labetalol. 5. The patient is felt to be a significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin, thromboprophylaxis (albeit understanding that it is inferior to Coumadin). 6. Continue Dilantin for history of seizures. "
166,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: I last saw her in 09/2008. Since then, she has been admitted to ABCD Hospital from 11/05/2008 through 11/08/2008 for a near syncopal episode. She was found to have a fast heart rate in the atrial fibrillation. She was also found to be in heart failure and so they diuresed her. They wanted to send her home on furosemide 40 mg daily, but unfortunately they never gave her a prescription for this and so she now is not on any furosemide and since being discharged she has regained fluid to no one's great surprise. My plan advent is to control her heart rate. This has been a bit difficult with her retaining fluid. We will try again to diurese her as an outpatient and go forward from there with rate control and anticoagulation. She may need to have a pacemaker placed and her AV node ablated if this does not work. MAJOR FINDINGS: On my comprehensive cardiovascular examination, she again looks the same which is in heart failure. Her blood pressure today was 130/60 and her pulse 116 blood pressure and regular. She is 5 feet 11 inches and her weight is 167 pounds, which is up from 158 pounds from when I saw her last visit. She is breathing 1two times per minute and it is unlabored. Eyelids are normal. She has vitiligo. Pupils are round and reactive to light. Conjunctivae are clear and sclerae are anicteric. There is no oral thrush or central cyanosis. She has marked keloid formation on both sides of her neck, the left being worse than the right. The jugular venous pressure is elevated. Carotids are brisk are without bruits. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. The precordium is quiet. The rhythm is irregularly irregular. She has a variable first and second heart sounds. No murmurs today. Abdomen is soft without hepatosplenomegaly or masses, although she does have hepatojugular reflux. She has no clubbing or cyanosis, but does have 1+ peripheral edema. Distal pulses are good. On neurological examination, her mentation is normal. Her mood and affect are normal. She is oriented to person, place, and time. ASSESSMENTS: She has chronic atrial fibrillation and heart failure now. PROBLEMS DIAGNOSES: 1. Chronic atrial fibrillation, anticoagulated and the plan is rate control. 2. Heart failure and she needs more diuretic. 3. High blood pressure controlled. 4. Hyperlipidemia. 5. Diabetes mellitus type 2. 6. Nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay. 7. History of alcohol abuse. 8. Osteoporosis. 9. Normal left ventricular function. PLANS: I have restarted her Lasix at 80 mg daily and I have asked her to return in about 10 days to the heart failure clinic. There, I would like them to recheck her heart rate and if still elevated, and she is truly on 150 mg of metoprolol twice a day, one could switch her amlodipine from 5 mg daily to diltiazem 120 mg daily. If this does not work, in terms of controlling her heart rate, then she will need to have a pacemaker and her AV node ablated. Pt take aspirin and propofol"
167,"Description: Chest pain, possible syncopal spells. She has been having multiple cardiovascular complaints including chest pains, which feel like cramps and sometimes like a dull ache, which will last all day long. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) REASON FOR REFERRAL: Chest pain, possible syncopal spells. She is a very pleasant 31-year-old mother of two children with ADD. She was doing okay until January of 2009 when she had a partial hysterectomy. Since then she just says ""things have changed"". She just does not want to go out anymore and just does not feel the same. Also, at the same time, she is having a lot of household stressors with both of her children having ADD and ODD and she feels she does not get enough support from her husband. Her 11-year-old is having a lot of trouble at school and she often has to go there to take care of problems. In this setting, she has been having multiple cardiovascular complaints including chest pains, which feel ""like cramps"" and sometimes like a dull ache, which will last all day long. She is also tender in the left breast area and gets numbness in her left hand. She has also had three spells of ""falling"", she is not really clear on whether these are syncopal, but they sound like they could be as she sees spots before her eyes. Twice it happened, when getting up quickly at night and another time in the grocery store. She suffered no trauma. She has no remote history of syncope. Her weight has not changed in the past year. IMPRESSION: 1. Syncopal spells - These do sound, in fact, to be syncopal. I suspect it is simple orthostasis/vasovagal, as her EKG and echocardiogram looks good. I have asked her to drink plenty of fluids and to not to get up suddenly at night. I think this should take care of the problem. I would not recommend further workup unless these spells continue, at which time I would recommend a tilt-table study. 2. Chest pains - Atypical for cardiac etiology, undoubtedly due to musculoskeletal factors from her emotional stressors. The Naprosyn is not helping that much, I gave her a prescription for Flexeril and instructed her in its use (not to drive after taking it). RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Reassurance that her cardiac checkup looks excellent, which it does. 2. Drink plenty of fluids and arise slowly from bed. 3. Flexeril 10 mg 4. I have asked her to return should the syncopal spells continue. hold parameters for lopressor and captopril"
